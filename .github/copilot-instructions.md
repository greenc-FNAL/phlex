# GitHub Copilot Instructions for Phlex Project

## Project Context & Workflow

### Repository Ecosystem

- **Primary Repository**: `Framework-R-D/phlex`
- **Design & Documentation**: `Framework-R-D/phlex-design` (contains design docs, coding guidelines, etc.)
- **Dependencies**: Critical dependency on `FNALssi/cetmodules` for the build system.
- **Container Images**:
  - `phlex-ci`: Used by automated CI checks.
  - `phlex-dev`: Used for VSCode devcontainers and local development.

### Development Workflow

- **Model**: Fork-based development. Developers should work on branches within their own forks.
- **Upstreaming**: Changes are upstreamed via Pull Requests (PRs) to the primary repository `Framework-R-D/phlex`.
- **Quality Standards**:
  - Adhere to design and coding guidelines in `Framework-R-D/phlex-design`.
  - Ensure code passes CI checks using the `phlex-ci` environment.
  - Minimize changes required for upstreaming.

## Communication Guidelines

### Professional Colleague Interaction

Interact with the developer as a professional colleague, not as a subordinate:

- Avoid sycophancy and obsequiousness
- Point out mistakes or correct misunderstandings when necessary, using professional and constructive language
- If the developer's request contains an error or misunderstanding, explain the issue clearly

### Truth and Accuracy

Accuracy and honesty are critical:

- If you lack sufficient information to complete a task, say so explicitly: "I don't know" or "I don't have access to the information needed"
- Ask the developer for help or additional information when needed
- Never fabricate answers or hide gaps in knowledge
- It is better to acknowledge limitations than to provide incorrect information

### Clear and Direct Communication

Be explicit and unambiguous in all responses:

- Use literal language; avoid idioms, metaphors, or figurative expressions that could be misinterpreted
- State assumptions explicitly rather than leaving them implicit
- When suggesting multiple options, clearly label them and explain the trade-offs
- If a request is ambiguous, ask specific clarifying questions before proceeding
- Provide concrete examples when explaining abstract concepts
- Break down complex tasks into explicit, numbered steps when helpful
- If you're uncertain about what the developer wants, state what you understand and ask for confirmation

### External Resources

When the developer provides HTTPS links in conversation:

- You are permitted and encouraged to fetch content from HTTPS URLs using the `fetch_webpage` tool
- This applies to documentation, GitHub issues, pull requests, specifications, RFCs, and other web-accessible resources
- Use the fetched content to provide accurate, up-to-date information in your responses
- If the link is not accessible or the content is unclear, report this explicitly
- Always verify that fetched information is relevant to the developer's question before incorporating it into your response

## Workspace Environment Setup

### setup-env.sh Integration

When working in this workspace, always source `setup-env.sh` before executing commands that depend on the build environment:

- **Repository version**: `srcs/phlex/scripts/setup-env.sh` - Multi-mode environment setup for developers
  - Supports standalone repository, multi-project workspace, Spack, and system packages
  - Gracefully degrades when optional dependencies (e.g., Spack) are unavailable
  - See `srcs/phlex/scripts/README.md` for detailed documentation
- **Workspace version**: `setup-env.sh` (workspace root) - Optional workspace-specific configuration
  - May exist in multi-project workspace setups
  - Can supplement or override repository setup-env.sh

Command execution guidelines:

- Use `. ./setup-env.sh && <command>` for terminal commands in workspaces with root-level setup-env.sh
- Use `. srcs/phlex/scripts/setup-env.sh && <command>` when working in standalone repository
- Ensure VS Code tasks include appropriate `source` command in their definitions
- Terminal sessions should source the setup script to access build tools (gcc, cmake, ninja, etc.)
- VS Code settings should use absolute paths or `${workspaceFolder}/local` rather than environment variables for IntelliSense configuration
- Always ensure that the terminal's current working directory is appropriate to the command being issued

### Source Directory Symbolic Links

If the workspace root contains a `srcs/` directory, it may contain symbolic links (e.g., `srcs/cetmodules` links to external repositories):

- Always use `find -L` or `find -follow` when searching for files in source directories
- This ensures `find` follows symbolic links and discovers all actual source files
- Without this flag, `find` will skip linked directories and miss significant portions of the codebase

## Text Formatting Standards

**CRITICAL: Apply to ALL files you create or edit (bash scripts, Python, C++, YAML, Markdown, etc.)**

- All text files must have their final line be non-empty and terminated with a single newline character, leaving no trailing blank lines
- **Never add trailing whitespace on any line** (spaces or tabs at end of lines)
- This includes blank lines - they should contain only the newline character, no spaces or tabs
- Exception: Markdown two-space line breaks (avoid; use proper paragraph breaks instead)

## Code Formatting Standards

### CMake Files

- Use cmake-format tool (VS Code auto-formats on save)
- Configuration: `dangle_align: "child"`, `dangle_parens: true`

## Markdown Rules

All Markdown files must strictly follow these markdownlint rules:

- **MD012**: No multiple consecutive blank lines (never more than one blank line in a row, anywhere)
- **MD022**: Headings must be surrounded by exactly one blank line before and after
- **MD031**: Fenced code blocks must be surrounded by exactly one blank line before and after
- **MD032**: Lists must be surrounded by exactly one blank line before and after (including after headings and code blocks)
- **MD034**: No bare URLs (for example, use a markdown link like `[text](destination)` instead of a plain URL)
- **MD036**: Use # headings, not **Bold:** for titles
- **MD040**: Always specify code block language (for example, use '```bash', '```python', '```text', etc.)

## Development & Testing Workflows

### Build and Test

- **Environment**: Always source `setup-env.sh` before building or testing. This applies to all environments (Dev Container, local machine, HPC).
- **Configuration**:
  - **Presets**: Prefer `CMakePresets.json` workflows (e.g., `cmake --preset default`).
  - **Generator**: Prefer `Ninja` over `Makefiles` when available (`-G Ninja`).
- **Build**:
  - **Parallelism**: Always use multiple cores. Ninja does this by default. For `make`, use `cmake --build build -j $(nproc)`.
- **Test**:
  - **Parallelism**: Run tests in parallel using `ctest -j $(nproc)` or `ctest --parallel <N>`.
  - **Selection**: Run specific tests with `ctest -R "regex"` (e.g., `ctest -R "py:*"`).
  - **Debugging**: Use `ctest --output-on-failure` to see logs for failed tests.

### Python Integration

- **Naming**: Avoid naming Python test scripts `types.py` or other names that shadow standard library modules. This causes obscure import errors (e.g., `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy'`).
- **PYTHONPATH**: When running tests in Spack environments, ensure `PYTHONPATH` includes `site-packages`. In CMake, explicitly add `Python_SITELIB` and `Python_SITEARCH` to `TEST_PYTHONPATH`.
- **Test Structure**:
  - **C++ Driver**: Provides data streams (e.g., `test/python/driver.cpp`).
  - **Jsonnet Config**: Wires the graph (e.g., `test/python/pytypes.jsonnet`).
  - **Python Script**: Implements algorithms (e.g., `test/python/test_types.py`).
- **Type Conversion**: `plugins/python/src/modulewrap.cpp` handles C++ ↔ Python conversion.
  - **Mechanism**: Uses string comparison of type names (e.g., `"float64]]"`). This is brittle.
  - **Requirement**: Ensure converters exist for all types used in tests (e.g., `float`, `double`, `unsigned int`, and their vector equivalents).
  - **Warning**: Exact type matches are required. `numpy.float32` != `float`.

### Coverage Analysis

- **Tooling**: The project uses LLVM source-based coverage.
- **Requirement**: The `phlex` binary must catch exceptions in `main` to ensure coverage data is flushed to disk even when tests fail/crash.
- **Generation**:
  - **CMake Targets**: `coverage-xml`, `coverage-html` (if configured).
  - **Manual**:
    1.  Run tests with `LLVM_PROFILE_FILE` set (e.g., `export LLVM_PROFILE_FILE="profraw/%m-%p.profraw"`).
    2.  Merge profiles: `llvm-profdata merge -sparse profraw/*.profraw -o coverage.profdata`.
    3.  Generate report: `llvm-cov show -instr-profile=coverage.profdata -format=html ...`

### Local GitHub Actions Testing (`act`)

- **Tool**: Use `act` to run GitHub Actions workflows locally.
- **Configuration**: Ensure `.actrc` exists in the workspace root with the following content to use a compatible runner image:
  ```text
  -P ubuntu-latest=catthehacker/ubuntu:act-latest
  ```
- **Usage**:
  - List jobs: `act -l`
  - Run specific job: `act -j <job_name>` (e.g., `act -j python-check`)
  - Run specific event: `act pull_request`
- **Troubleshooting**:
  - **Docker Socket**: `act` requires access to the Docker socket. In dev containers, this may require specific mount configurations or permissions.
  - **Artifacts**: `act` creates a `phlex-src` directory (or similar) for checkout. Ensure this is cleaned up or ignored by tools like `mypy`.
