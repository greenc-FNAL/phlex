# Using Reusable Workflows from the Phlex Repository

## Overview and General Instructions

The workflows in `Framework-R-D/phlex/` maybe invoked as follows:

1. Automatically as part of CI checks on a PR submitted to `Framework-R-D/phlex`, at PR creation time and thereafter on pushes to the PR branch. This should work whether your PR branch is situated in the primary repository or a fork.
1. Via triggering comments on the PR (`@phlexbot <action>`).
1. Via the "actions" tab on the project's GitHub web page.

Additionally, you can configure your own fork of Phlex to run CI checks on local PRs, and on its default branch, following the instructions below.

If you are a Phlex-affiliated developer working on a dependent package of Phlex, or on a different Cetmodules-using package, or on Cetmodules itself, you may be able to invoke these workflows on your own project following the information in this guide. However, this is only supported for Phlex-affiliated developers, and even then on a best effort basis. We do **not** support or encourage others to utilize these workflows at this time.

#### Running Workflows Manually (`workflow_dispatch`)

Most workflows in this repository can be run manually on any branch, tag, or commit. This is useful for testing changes without creating a pull request or for applying fixes to a specific branch.

To run a workflow manually:

1.  Navigate to the **Actions** tab of the Phlex repository (or your fork).
1.  In the left sidebar, click the workflow you want to run (e.g., **Clang-Format Check**).
1.  Above the list of workflow runs, you will see a banner that says "This workflow has a `workflow_dispatch` event trigger." Click the **Run workflow** dropdown on the right.
1.  Use the **Branch/tag** dropdown to select the branch you want to run the workflow on.
1.  Some workflows have additional inputs (e.g., the `cmake-build` workflow allows you to specify build combinations). Fill these out as needed.
1.  Click the **Run workflow** button.

### For Contributors Working on a Fork of Phlex

If you are developing on a fork of `Framework-R-D/phlex` itself, the CI/CD workflows will run automatically on your pull requests within the fork, just as they do on the main repository. You do not need to use the `uses:` syntax described below.

However, to enable the automatic fixing features (e.g., for `cmake-format-fix` or `python-fix`), you will need to perform two steps:

1. **Enable Workflows:** By default, GitHub Actions are disabled on forks. You must manually enable them by going to the `Actions` tab of your forked repository and clicking the "I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them" button.
1. **Create the `WORKFLOW_PAT` Secret:** The auto-fix workflows require a Personal Access Token (PAT) with write permissions to commit changes back to your PR branch. Follow the instructions below to create a PAT and add it as a secret named `WORKFLOW_PAT` **to your forked repository's settings**.

Once you have done this, you can trigger the auto-fix workflows by commenting on a pull request in your fork (e.g., `@phlexbot format`).

### Creating a Personal Access Token (PAT)

For workflows that automatically commit fixes to pull requests (e.g., formatters), you must create a Personal Access Token (PAT) and add it as a secret to your repository.

1. **Create a PAT:** Follow the GitHub documentation to [create a fine-grained personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token).
   -  Give it a descriptive name (e.g., `WORKFLOW_FIXES_PAT`).
   -  Grant it the following repository permissions:
      -  `Contents`: `Read and write`
      -  `Pull requests`: `Read and write`
2. **Add the PAT as a Repository Secret:**
   -  In your repository, go to `Settings` > `Secrets and variables` > `Actions`.
   -  Create a new repository secret named `WORKFLOW_PAT` and paste your PAT as the value.

### Calling a Reusable Workflow from a Different Repository

To use a workflow, you call it from a workflow file in your own repository's `.github/workflows/` directory. The basic syntax is:

```yaml
jobs:
  some_job:
    uses: Framework-R-D/phlex/.github/workflows/<workflow_file_name>.yaml@cef968c52aab432b836bb28119a9661c82c8b0d1
    with:
      # ... inputs for the workflow ...
    secrets:
      WORKFLOW_PAT: ${{ secrets.WORKFLOW_PAT }}
```

You should follow the instructions in the previous section to create the `WORKFLOW_PAT` secret for your own repository.

**Note:** For stability and security, it is highly recommended to pin the workflow to a specific commit SHA rather than a branch like `@main`. Using a mutable branch means you will automatically receive updates, which could include breaking changes or, in a worst-case scenario, malicious code. Pinning to a commit SHA ensures you are using a fixed, reviewed version of the workflow.

For development purposes, you may choose to use `@main` at your own risk to get the latest changes.

## Available Workflows and Their Inputs

### 1. `cmake-build.yaml`

Builds and tests your project using CMake.

#### Usage Example

```yaml
jobs:
  build_and_test:
    uses: Framework-R-D/phlex/.github/workflows/cmake-build.yaml@cef968c52aab432b836bb28119a9661c82c8b0d1
    with:
      # Optional: A list of build combinations to run (e.g., "gcc/asan clang/tsan")
      build-combinations: 'all -clang/valgrind'
      # Required for PRs from forks if you want auto-formatting to work
      ref: ${{ github.head_ref }}
      repo: ${{ github.repository }}
```

#### All Inputs

-  `checkout-path` (string, optional): Path to check out code to.
-  `build-path` (string, optional): Path for build artifacts.
-  `skip-relevance-check` (boolean, optional, default: `false`): Bypass the check that only runs the build if C++ or CMake files have changed.
-  `build-combinations` (string, optional): A space-separated list of build combinations to run.
-  `ref` (string, optional): The branch or ref to check out.
-  `repo` (string, optional): The repository to check out from (e.g., `my-org/my-repo`).
-  `pr-base-sha` (string, optional): Base SHA of the PR for relevance check.
-  `pr-head-sha` (string, optional): Head SHA of the PR for relevance check.

### 2. `python-check.yaml`

Checks Python code for formatting and type errors using `ruff` and `mypy`.

#### Usage Example

```yaml
jobs:
  check_python:
    uses: Framework-R-D/phlex/.github/workflows/python-check.yaml@cef968c52aab432b836bb28119a9661c82c8b0d1
```

#### All Inputs

-  `checkout-path` (string, optional): Path to check out code to.
-  `skip-relevance-check` (boolean, optional, default: `false`): Bypass the check that only runs if Python files have changed.
-  `pr-base-sha` (string, optional): Base SHA of the PR for relevance check.
-  `pr-head-sha` (string, optional): Head SHA of the PR for relevance check.

### 3. `cmake-format-fix.yaml`

Automatically formats CMake files using `gersemi` and commits the changes. Typically triggered by an `issue_comment`.

#### Usage Example (in a workflow triggered by `issue_comment`)

```yaml
name: 'Bot Commands'
on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]

jobs:
  format-cmake:
    # Run only on comments from collaborators/owners that start with the bot command
    if: >
      github.event.issue.pull_request &&
      (github.event.comment.author_association == 'COLLABORATOR' || github.event.comment.author_association == 'OWNER') &&
      startsWith(github.event.comment.body, format('@{0}bot format', github.event.repository.name))
    uses: Framework-R-D/phlex/.github/workflows/cmake-format-fix.yaml@cef968c52aab432b836bb28119a9661c82c8b0d1
    with:
      # The ref and repo of the PR need to be retrieved and passed
      ref: ${{ steps.get_pr_info.outputs.ref }}
      repo: ${{ steps.get_pr_info.outputs.repo }}
    secrets:
      WORKFLOW_PAT: ${{ secrets.WORKFLOW_PAT }}

*Similar to `cmake-format-fix.yaml`, but triggered by a command like `@<repo>bot markdown-fix`.*

#### All Inputs

-  `checkout-path` (string, optional): Path to check out code to.
-  `ref` (string, **required**): The branch or ref to check out.
