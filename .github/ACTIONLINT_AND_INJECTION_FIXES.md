# Actionlint and Injection Vulnerability Fixes

## Overview

This document describes the actionlint errors and injection vulnerabilities that were identified and fixed in the GitHub Actions workflows.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Actionlint Errors: Incorrect workflow_call References

Three workflows were referencing `inputs.repo` and `inputs.pr-base-sha` in conditional expressions, but these workflows were not intended to support `workflow_call`:

- `.github/workflows/clang-format-check.yaml`
- `.github/workflows/clang-tidy-check.yaml`
- `.github/workflows/coverage.yaml`

**Error Messages:**
```
property "repo" is not defined in object type {ref: string}
property "pr-base-sha" is not defined in object type {ref: string}
```

**Root Cause:** These workflows had logic to handle `workflow_call` events (e.g., `github.event_name == 'workflow_call' && inputs.repo`) from a previous AI task, but these workflows were never intended to be reusable. According to the repository documentation, these workflows are "specifically intended for use on this repository and its forks" and should not support `workflow_call`.

### 2. Injection Vulnerability in cmake-build.yaml

Line 211 in `cmake-build.yaml` had a shell injection vulnerability:

```yaml
run: echo "name=$(echo '${{ needs.pre-check.outputs.repo }}' | sed 's:.*/::')" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"
```

**Security Risk:** The `${{ needs.pre-check.outputs.repo }}` expression is directly interpolated into the shell command. If an attacker could control the value of `needs.pre-check.outputs.repo`, they could inject arbitrary shell commands.

**Example Attack:** If `repo` contained `'; malicious-command; echo '`, it would be executed.

## Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Remove Incorrect workflow_call Support

Removed the `workflow_call` trigger and simplified the output expressions in three workflows that were not intended to be reusable:

**Changes in clang-format-check.yaml, clang-tidy-check.yaml, and coverage.yaml:**

Removed the entire `workflow_call:` section with all its inputs, and simplified the pre-check job outputs:

**Before:**
```yaml
outputs:
  ref: ${{ (github.event_name == 'workflow_call' && inputs.ref) || (github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch' && (github.event.inputs.ref || github.ref)) || github.sha }}
  repo: ${{ (github.event_name == 'workflow_call' && inputs.repo) || github.repository }}
  base_sha: ${{ (github.event_name == 'workflow_call' && inputs.pr-base-sha) || github.event.pull_request.base.sha || github.event.before }}
```

**After:**
```yaml
outputs:
  ref: ${{ (github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch' && (github.event.inputs.ref || github.ref)) || github.sha }}
  repo: ${{ github.repository }}
  base_sha: ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.sha || github.event.before }}
```

The workflows now only support `pull_request` and `workflow_dispatch` triggers, as originally intended.

### Fix 2: Mitigate Injection Vulnerability

Changed the shell command in `cmake-build.yaml` to use an environment variable:

**Before:**
```yaml
- name: Extract repository name
  id: repo_name
  run: echo "name=$(echo '${{ needs.pre-check.outputs.repo }}' | sed 's:.*/::')" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"
```

**After:**
```yaml
- name: Extract repository name
  id: repo_name
  env:
    REPO_FULL_NAME: ${{ needs.pre-check.outputs.repo }}
  run: echo "name=${REPO_FULL_NAME##*/}" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"
```

**Security Improvement:**
1. The GitHub expression `${{ needs.pre-check.outputs.repo }}` is now assigned to an environment variable `REPO_FULL_NAME`
2. Environment variables are not subject to shell injection - they are passed as values, not code
3. Bonus: Replaced `sed` with bash parameter expansion (`${REPO_FULL_NAME##*/}`) which is more efficient and addresses a shellcheck style warning

## Best Practices for Preventing Injection

When using GitHub Actions expressions in shell commands:

1. **Use environment variables:** Always pass untrusted data through environment variables
   ```yaml
   env:
     MY_VAR: ${{ github.event.issue.title }}
   run: echo "$MY_VAR"
   ```

2. **Never interpolate directly:** Avoid this pattern:
   ```yaml
   run: echo "${{ github.event.issue.title }}"  # DANGEROUS
   ```

3. **Validate inputs:** Use GitHub Actions input validation when possible

4. **Use actions instead of scripts:** When feasible, use composite actions or JavaScript actions instead of shell scripts

## Verification

All fixes were verified using:

1. **actionlint:** Ran actionlint on all workflows - 0 errors reported
2. **YAML validation:** Verified all workflow files have valid YAML syntax
3. **Shellcheck:** The improved shell script addresses shellcheck style warnings
