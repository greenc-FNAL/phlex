## Installation

Users of Phlex do not need to clone this repository.
Instead, following the instructions for [installing Phlex](INSTALLATION.md).

## Getting starting with using Phlex

Once you have Phlex installed, you can start creating algorithms and using them in Phlex workflows.
[A repository with example user code](https://github.com/framework-r-d/phlex-examples) is available to help you get started.
Clone that repository and follow the instructions there to begin using Phlex.


## Developing Phlex

Instructions for the development of Phlex itself are in the [developer notes](DEVELOPING.md)

## CI/CD

This repository provides a suite of reusable GitHub Actions workflows for building, testing, and formatting C++ and Python projects. For comprehensive instructions on how to use these workflows in your own project, please see the [reusable workflows guide](./.github/REUSABLE_WORKFLOWS.md).
